title: Static web generation
published: true
---

from the moment I start to blog github, I noticed static web generation could be something good in future.
actually after diving into it a while, this is not any new technology. from 2013 there have been people talking
using [jekyll], and today I find more alternatives, like [webgen], and even place like [staticgen] collect
almost all types of static generation available in the market.
<p/>
most of them rubys, fine.
